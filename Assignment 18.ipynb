    "The main distinction between the two approaches is the use of labeled datasets. To put it simply, supervised learning uses labeled input and output data, while an unsupervised learning algorithm does not. Unsupervised learning models, in contrast, work on their own to discover the inherent structure of unlabeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Supervised learning, you train the machine using data which is well “labeled.” Unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique, where you do not need to supervise the model. For example, Baby can identify other dogs based on past supervised learning.\n",

    "\n",
    "ANS =\n",
    "\n",
    "The various types of clustering are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Connectivity-based Clustering (Hierarchical clustering): Hierarchical Clustering is a method of unsupervised machine learning clustering where it begins with a pre-defined top to bottom hierarchy of clusters. It then proceeds to perform a decomposition of the data objects based on this hierarchy, hence obtaining the clusters. This method follows two approaches based on the direction of progress, i.e., whether it is the top-down or bottom-up flow of creating clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Centroids-based Clustering (Partitioning methods): Centroid based clustering is considered as one of the most simplest clustering algorithms, yet the most effective way of creating clusters and assigning data points to it. The intuition behind centroid based clustering is that a cluster is characterized and represented by a central vector and data points that are in close proximity to these vectors are assigned to the respective clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Density-based Clustering (Model-based methods): If one looks into the previous two methods that we discussed, one would observe that both hierarchical and centroid based algorithms are dependent on a distance (similarity/proximity) metric. The very definition of a cluster is based on this metric. Density-based clustering methods take density into consideration instead of distances. Clusters are considered as the densest region in a data space, which is separated by regions of lower object density and it is defined as a maximal-set of connected points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distribution-based Clustering: Until now, the clustering techniques as we know are based around either proximity (similarity/distance) or composition (density). There is a family of clustering algorithms that take a totally different metric into consideration – probability. Distribution-based clustering creates and groups data points based on their likely hood of belonging to the same probability distribution (Gaussian, Binomial etc.) in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fuzzy Clustering: The general idea about clustering revolves around assigning data points to mutually exclusive clusters, meaning, a data point always resides uniquely inside a cluster and it cannot belong to more than one cluster. Fuzzy clustering methods change this paradigm by assigning a data-point to multiple clusters with a quantified degree of belongingness metric. The data-points that are in proximity to the center of a cluster, may also belong in the cluster that is at a higher degree than points in the edge of a cluster. The possibility of which an element belongs to a given cluster is measured by membership coefficient that vary from 0 to 1.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS =\n",
    "\n",
    "K centroids are created randomly (based on the predefined value of K) 2.K-means allocates every data point in the dataset to the nearest centroid (minimizing Euclidean distances between them), meaning that a data point is considered to be in a particular cluster if it is closer to that cluster’s centroid than any other centroid. 3.Then K-means recalculates the centroids by taking the mean of all data points assigned to that centroid’s cluster, hence reducing the total intra-cluster variance in relation to the previous step. The “means” in the K-means refers to averaging the data and finding the new centroid. 4.The algorithm iterates between steps 2 and 3 until some criteria is met (e.g. the sum of distances between the data points and their corresponding centroid is minimized, a maximum number of iterations is reached, no changes in centroids value or no data points change clusters)\n",

    " K-means attempts to minimize the total squared error, while k-medoids minimizes the sum of dissimilarities between points labeled to be in a cluster and a point designated as the center of that cluster. In contrast to the k -means algorithm, k -medoids chooses datapoints as centers ( medoids or exemplars).\n",

    "ANS =\n",

    "It is a diagram that helps to do the visualization for hierarchical clustering. The main objective of using the Dendrogram is to make an optimal number of clusters and to allocate objects to clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the closest point and make it a cluster-based upon Euclidean Distance. y-axis is the closest Euclidean Distance and the x-axis is having all data points. Again, find the clusters that are having the least distance between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, p2 and p3 are having its own cluster and p1 is closest to it so we create a full cluster and plot it on the dendrogram graph.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, combine 2 clusters into a single cluster, and our dendrogram graph is ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "So from the above example, we have created a dendrogram no we need to find what is an optimal number of the cluster from the dendrogram. Let us draw a horizontal line on the dendrogram graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "It means the number of lines cut from the threshold horizontal line that is the number of clusters formed. So 2 clusters are formed from the above example.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, now the important question is when the distance is the largest, we can set that line as the threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the line cutting the largest distance is a threshold line that is, 2 clusters are formed.\n",

    "\n",
    "The SSE is defined as the sum of the squared Euclidean distances of each point to its closest centroid. Since this is a measure of error, the objective of k-means is to try to minimize this value. The purpose of this figure is to show that the initialization of the centroids is an important step.\n",

    "The Apriori algorithm uses frequent itemsets to generate association rules, and it is designed to work on the databases that contain transactions. With the help of these association rule, it determines how strongly or how weakly two objects are connected. This algorithm uses a breadth-first search and Hash Tree to calculate the itemset associations efficiently. It is the iterative process for finding the frequent itemsets from the large dataset. It is mainly used for market basket analysis and helps to find those products that can be bought together. It can also be used in the healthcare field to find drug reactions for patients.\n"
