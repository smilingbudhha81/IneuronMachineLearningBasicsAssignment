    "Prior probability is calculated as the probability of an event before an experiment is performed using more data. In simple words, Prior probability is a part of Bayes theorem which is calculated as the probability of an event which is about to occur.\n",

    "ANS = \n",

    "Naive Bayes is a simple and powerful algorithm for predictive modeling. Naive Bayes is called naive because it assumes that each input variable is independent. This is a strong assumption and unrealistic for real data; however, the technique is very effective on a large range of complex problems.\n",

Bayes Optimal Classifier is a probabilistic model that finds the most probable prediction using the training data and space of hypotheses to make a prediction for a new data instance.\n",

    "Bayesian classifiers are highly impacted by presence of imbalanced data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Bayesian classifier starts with an assumption of all features being independent variables, the result can be far from real life in cases. Additionally in terms of mathematics, the algorithm assigns 0 to the target variable class labels that were not present in the training data but are present in test data.\n",

    "Naive Bayes classifiers work by correlating the use of tokens (typically words, or sometimes other things), with spam and non-spam e-mails and then using Bayes' theorem to calculate a probability that an email is or is not spam. It is one of the oldest ways of doing spam filtering, with roots in the 1990s.\n",
